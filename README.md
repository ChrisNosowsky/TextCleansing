# TextCleansing
Used for text cleansing.


What does this accomplish?

Good question! If you have a .txt or .csv file, you could actually implement it into the dictionary class and run it against the class. It will call a function that takes raw text, and outputs another file that contains all the words that were in the text along with it's frequency

Example: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
the : 2
brown : 1
dog : 1
fox : 1
jumped : 1
lazy : 1
over : 1
quick : 1


As shown above, it organizes the file by frequency and it orders it alphabetically. This can be used to train and test models in Machine Learning.
